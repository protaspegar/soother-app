# Soother App v0.3

This is a simple react-native app designed to sooth your baby to sleep.

## Features

1. It's orange: 
OK, this is not a feature. 
But the orange background color does not affect your night vision and does not affect your sleep like blue leds.

2. Fading lights:
The background light fades in and out in a rythm that mimics your respiration.
This light effect creates a calming sensation that helps your baby to fall asleep.

3. Background sounds:
You can enable a background noise to help your baby fall asleep.
For now, there is only one sound available: calm nature

4. Changing sound volume:
When the screen is bright, the volume is higher. When the scree is dark, the volume is lower.
The effect of the sound fading out, helps the baby to fall asleep, while the sound fading in does not have any impact.


## Next Steps

1. Add slider control to change the frequency of the fading effect. 
The user would be able to set is slower or faster as he/she finds more suitable for the baby.

2. Add white-noise as a new sound option with a dropbox to choose the desired sound.
