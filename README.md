# Soother App

This is a simple react-native app designed to sooth your baby to sleep.

## Features

1. It's orange: 
OK, this is not a feature. 
But the orange background color does not affect your night vision and does not affect your sleep like blue leds.

2. Fading lights:
The background light fades in and out in a rithm that mimics your respiration.
This light effect creates a calming sensation that helps your baby to fall asleep.

3. Background sounds:
This is still in progress. The first sound being implemented is a whitenoise.
