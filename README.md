# Soother App

This is a simple react-native app designed to sooth your baby to sleep.

## Features

1. It's orange: 
OK, this is not a feature. 
But the orange background color does not affect your night vision and does not affect your sleep like blue leds.

2. Fading lights:
The background light fades in and out in a rythm that mimics your respiration.
This light effect creates a calming sensation that helps your baby to fall asleep.

3. Background sounds:
You can enable a background noise to help your baby fall asleep.
For now, there is only one sound available: calm nature


## Next Steps

1. Improve controls to show and hide buttons according to current state.
For instance, if the sound is playing, the "Play Sound" button should be hidden or disabled.

2. Add option to adjust the volume according to the color.
When the screen is bright, the volume will be higher. When the scree is dark, the volume will be lower.
The effect of the sound fading out, helps the baby to fall asleep, while the sound fading in does not have any impact.

3. Add slider control to change the frequency of the fading effect. 
The user would be able to set is slower or faster as he/she finds more suitable for the baby.
